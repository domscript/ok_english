<Intro>

This blog is the official source for the updates from the Domscript. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted here first. You can also follow the [@domscript](https://twitter.com/domscript) account on Twitter, but you wonâ€™t miss anything essential if you only read this blog.
