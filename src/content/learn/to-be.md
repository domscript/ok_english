>While the <CodeStep step={5}>red colored phrases</CodeStep> are grammatically correct, they are quite rare in everyday English usage. It is generally not commonly used because it can sound awkward and redundant. Instead, we tend to use simpler constructions to express the same idea.

Use this structure for the present progressive tense for “to be” verbs: 

Subject + be verb + verb + ing 

      > Examples:
      > * I am watching television. 
      > * You are pushing the wrong button. 
      > * He is looking at the window. 
      > * She is studying.

**Question tags using “to be” verbs**

You can add a question tag to the end of a statement to turn it into a question. To put question tags onto sentences using “to be” verbs, use this structure: 

statement + “to be” verb + pronoun. The “to be” verb used in the question tag must be the same one used in the statement.

Note: When adding question tags, if the “to be” verb in the statement is positive, then the one in the question tag must be negative. If the “to be” verb statement is negative, the one in the question tag, must be positive. 

Just think: 

+statement - question tag

-statement + question tag

      > Examples:
      > * I wasn’t being rude, was I? (negative statement with positive question tag) 
      > * It was good, wasn’t it? (positive statement with negative question tag)
      > * You were there, weren’t you? (positive statement with negative question tag)
      > * It wasn’t too bad, was it? (negative question tag with positive question tag)
      > * They weren’t angry, were they? (negative statement with positive question tag)

      > * I want to be a singer. 
      > * He likes to be the best at what he does. 
      > * They hope to be friends.

When making these negative, you’ll put do not or does not before the modal verb.

      > Examples: 
      > * Note: following don’t or doesn’t modal verbs such as like, want, need, or hope will stay in base form. 
      > * I don’t want to be difficult. 
      > * He does not like to be mean. 
      > * She doesn’t want to be a musician.

In sentences using the passive voice, the person or thing which is performing the action is either in the object of the sentence or even omitted. When written, the noun performing the action is normally found following a preposition such as “by”

Subject + “to be” verb + verb or
Subject + “to be” verb + verb + by + object
