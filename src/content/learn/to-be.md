You can add a question tag to the end of a statement to turn it into a question. To put question tags onto sentences using “to be” verbs, use this structure: 

statement + “to be” verb + pronoun. The “to be” verb used in the question tag must be the same one used in the statement.

Note: When adding question tags, if the “to be” verb in the statement is positive, then the one in the question tag must be negative. If the “to be” verb statement is negative, the one in the question tag, must be positive. 

Just think: 

+statement - question tag

-statement + question tag

      > Examples:

      > * It was good, wasn’t it? (positive statement with negative question tag)

      > * You should be nice to your parents. 
      > * When giving suggestions, it is a little more complicated.

      > * I suggest you be nice to your mother.

**Structure: “to be” verb + complement or**

Do not + “to be” verb + complement

      > Examples: 
      > * Be a good student. 
      > * Be nice to your teacher. 
      > * Don’t be mean to him. 

**When to use “to be” verbs as infinitives.**

      > * I want to be a singer. 
      > * He likes to be the best at what he does. 
      > * They hope to be friends.

When making these negative, you’ll put do not or does not before the modal verb.

      > Examples: 
      > * Note: following don’t or doesn’t modal verbs such as like, want, need, or hope will stay in base form. 
      > * I don’t want to be difficult. 
      > * He does not like to be mean. 
      > * She doesn’t want to be a musician.

In sentences using the passive voice, the person or thing which is performing the action is either in the object of the sentence or even omitted. When written, the noun performing the action is normally found following a preposition such as “by”

Subject + “to be” verb + verb or
Subject + “to be” verb + verb + by + object
