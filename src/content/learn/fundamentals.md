- What is variable
- What is value

</YouWillLearn>

A variable is like a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.

```js
  // ðŸ”´ Never (almost never) define a variable "var"!
  // use "const" and if you will redeclare it later use "let"!
const firstName = 'Dom';
const $nameLength = 3;
const _myFirstJob = "Coder";
const SOME_AWESOME_CONSTANT = 42;
```

#### Variable naming all the way down {/*variable-naming-all-the-way-down*/}

**By convention for JavaScript you should use:**
