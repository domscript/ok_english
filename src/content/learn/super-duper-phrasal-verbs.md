#### Phrasal verbs {/*phrasal-verbs*/}

Phrasal verbs combine a base verb with another word, usually a preposition or adverb – known as a particle – to create a completely new meaning. They are common in everyday spoken English. For example, words like `wake up`, `sit down`, and `get up`.

It’s impossible for an English speaker in the United States to go a day without using one of those words.

Interestingly, we don’t use phrasal verbs as much when we write, or in formal communication, like in a speech. But **in normal spoken English, about 80 percent of our verbs are phrasal verbs.**

If you studied the English language for years, then came to the United States and couldn’t understand anything, this is probably one of the reasons why. If you like this guide, check out our guide to English `Adjectives` and `prepositions` too.
