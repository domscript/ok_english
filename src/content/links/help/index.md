<Intro>

I don't know why but a lot of sites don't let you modify the cheat sheet for example hide known or unused data.

## Modify emmet-cheatsheet for your needs {/*modify-emmet-cheatsheet-for-your-needs*/}

Modify your own **[emmet-cheatsheet!](https://emmet-cheatsheet.netlify.app/)** hide unused data or if you already know them.

All changes save on your Local Storage.

Emmet can be helpful with html, css, sass, react writing JSX and it using it can improve your productivity.

It's the same **[emmet-cheatsheet!](https://emmet-cheatsheet.netlify.app/)** but with less distractive information.
